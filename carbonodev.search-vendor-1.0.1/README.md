- Based on Search Node Modules extension by Jason Nutter: [https://github.com/jasonnutter/vscode-search-node-modules](https://github.com/jasonnutter/vscode-search-node-modules)

Simple plugin for VS Code that allows you to navigate through the files inside your project's `vendor` directory.

Chances are you have the `vendor` folder excluded from the built-in search in VS Code, which means if you want to open and/or edit a file inside `vendor`, you can have to find it manually, which can be annoying when your `vendor` folder is large.

## Features

- Navigate and open files inside the `vendor` directory by traversing the folder tree.

## Settings

- `search-vendor.useLastFolder`: Default to folder of last opened file when searching (defaults to `false`).
- `search-vendor.path`: Relative path to vendor folder (defaults to `vendor`).
